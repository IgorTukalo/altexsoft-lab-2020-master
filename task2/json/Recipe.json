    "Description": "How do you cook duck in the oven? Do you stuff it with apples , rice, cabbage? Or messing around with the filling isn't yours? In this case, take note of a simple dish - duck marinated in soy sauce and honey. It is being prepared practically without your participation. The roasting sleeve and oven will do all the work for you.  A duck in a sleeve baked in the oven has a number of advantages: the meat cooks relatively quickly, retains a lot of moisture and turns out to be incredibly juicy, and besides, you don't need to wash a whole mountain of dishes. Rub the carcass with spices, marinate, wrap in a sleeve and put in the oven for 2 hours. The gala dinner will be ready by the appointed time!",
